 * The program is a piles game. It will run by asking for the users names then 
 * the amount of games that they would like to play (going upto three) while keeping scores
 * tried to the user that wins the game. Then looping to the wanted number and out puting the game
 * that the players is up to. Once the game has been setup and user input for names has been aquired
 * it will then choose a random number of counters to put in the array state the amount in each pile.
 * After this the program will randomly pick which player will start
